## Figure plan (data sources + outputs)

This deck is designed to compile even when figures are not present yet. Where applicable, figures should be generated by the profitability checker and then copied into this deck’s `assets/` folder.

### Primary data sources
- **Profitability checker repo**: `/Users/df/projects/dev/layer-profitability-checker/`
  - CLI: `uv run prof-check --profitability`
  - Outputs (expected):
    - `current_apr_chart.png`
    - `apr_by_total_stake.png`
    - `data/*.csv` (time series snapshots)
- **Tellor LaTeX workspace**: `/Users/df/projects/dev/LaTeX/presentations/layer-tokenomics/`

### Where figures should live in this deck
- Recommended folder: `assets/figures/`
- Brand assets:
  - Currently referenced via `../rewards-presentation/assets/brand/`
  - Optional later: copy into `assets/brand/` for portability

### Slide-to-figure mapping

#### `sections/economics.tex`
- **Slide “APR vs stake (chart)”**
  - **Existing output**: `layer-profitability-checker/current_apr_chart.png`
  - **Action**: copy to `assets/figures/current_apr_chart.png`
  - **Purpose**: visualize APR vs individual stake; annotate median + break-even.

- **Slide “APR vs total network stake (adoption / saturation)”**
  - **Existing output**: `layer-profitability-checker/apr_by_total_stake.png`
  - **Action**: copy to `assets/figures/apr_by_total_stake.png`
  - **Purpose**: show APR compression as total stake grows.

- **Slide “Break-even”**
  - **Existing data**: printed by checker + can be derived from:
    - avg fee (from recent MsgSubmitValue txs)
    - avg rewards per block (from mint events / expected calc)
    - total network stake
  - **Presentation**: start as a single number callout; optionally add a small sensitivity table later.

- **Slide “Realized vs modeled earnings (credibility)”**
  - **Existing data**: `--rewards ADDRESS` path uses `rewards_accumulated` + balance deltas.
  - **Presentation**: table on slide (no figure required initially).
  - **Optional new figure**: time series line plot of realized gross rewards/day vs fees/day.

- **Slide “Tips market snapshot (demand signal)”**
  - **Existing data**: current tips by query and total tips.
  - **Optional new figures**:
    - bar chart: top N tipped queries
    - line chart: total tips all-time (if we start saving daily snapshots)

- **Slide “Stake/power distribution (competition + concentration)”**
  - **Existing today**: checker prints distributions to terminal (ASCII).
  - **Recommended new figures** (to avoid screenshots):
    - histogram: validator stake distribution (from validator list)
    - histogram: reporter power distribution (from reporters list)
    - concentration: top-k share + HHI/Gini (simple bar/table)

#### `sections/mechanisms.tex`
- **Slide “Bootstrap extra rewards”**
  - **Existing data**: pool balance + estimated time remaining (checker prints).
  - **Optional new figure**: “runway” bar (pool balance / daily spend).

#### `sections/token_flows.tex`
- Uses TikZ figure `figures/token_flows_tikz.tex` (already in-repo; no external assets).

### New plots to implement later (prioritized)
1. Validator stake distribution histogram + top-k share table
2. Reporter power distribution histogram + top-k share table
3. Tips top-N queries bar chart (current snapshot)
4. Extra rewards runway bar chart
5. Realized P&L time series (rewards vs fees) for a sample address
