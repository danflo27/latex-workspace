\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{What we can say now}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mechanisms are clear: time-based rewards + tips + disputes.
    \item Operator economics can be framed as service compensation with measurable costs.
    \item Early phase may include bootstrap extra rewards (separate from steady-state).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Next steps}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fill external comps placeholders (blue-chip yields + LP risk cautionary).
    \item Add realized P\&L reporting for a few operator addresses (credibility).
    \item Quantify security coverage ratio per integration (define value-secured).
  \end{itemize}
